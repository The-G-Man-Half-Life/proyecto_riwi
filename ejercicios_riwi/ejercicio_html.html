        <p> in this post, weŕe excited to introduce SafeTest, 
            a revolutionary 
            library that offers a fresh
            perspective on End-To-End (E2E)
            tests for web-based User Interface(UI) applications.
        </p>
        <h3> The Challenges of Traditional UI Testing</h3>
        <p> Traditionally, UI tests have been conducted through either unit testing or integration testing (also referred to as
        End-To-End (E2E) testing). However, each of these methods presents a unique trade-off: you have to choose between
        controlling the test fixture and setup, or controlling the test driver.
        </p>
        <p>
        For instance, when using react-testing-library, a unit testing solution, you maintain complete control over what to
        render and how the underlying services and imports should behave. However, you lose the ability to interact with an
        actual page, which can lead to a myriad of pain points:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty in interacting with complex UI elements like &lt;Dropdown/&gt; components</li>
            <li>Inability to test CORPS setup or GraphQL calls.</li>
            <li>Lack of visibility into z-index issues affecting click-ability of buttons.</li>
            <li>Complex and inuntuitive authoring and debugging of tests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Conversely, using integration testing tools like Cypress or Playwright provides control over the page, but sacrifices 
            the ability to instrument the bootstrapping code for the app. These tools operate by remotely controlling a browser to
            visit a URL and interact with the page.</p>
        <p>This approach has its own set of challenges:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty in making calls to an alternative API endpoint without implementing custom network layer API rewrite rules.</li>
            <li>Inability to make assetions on spies/mocks or execute code within the app.</li>
            <li>Testing something like dark mode entails clicking the theme switcher or knowing the localStorage mechanism to override.</li>
            <li>Inability to test segments of the app, for example if a component is only visible after clicking a button for a 60 
                second timer to countdown, the test will need to run those actions and will be at least a minute long.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> 
            Recognizing these challenges, solutions like E2E component Testing have emerged, with offerings from Cypress and Playwright.
            . While these tools attempt to rectify the shortcomings of traditional integration testing methods, they have other limitations due to 
            their architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            They start a dev server with bootstrapping code to load the component and/or setup code you want, which limits their ability
            to handle complex enterprise  applications that might have OAuth or a complex build pipeline. Moreover, updating TypeScript usage could break your
            tests until the Cypress/Playwright team updates their runner.
        </p>
        <h3> Welcome to SafeTest</h3>
        <p>SafeTest aims to address these issues with a novel approach to UI testing. The main idea is to have a snippet of code in
        our application bootstrapping stage that injects hooks to run our tests (see the How Safetest Works sections for more
        info on what this is doing).<strong> Note that how this works has no measurable impact on the regular usage of your app since
        SafeTest leverages lazy loading to dynamically load the tests only when running the tests (in the README example, the
        tests aren't in the production bundle at all).</strong> Once that’s in place, we can use Playwright to run regular tests, thereby
        achieving the ideal browser control we want for our tests.</p>
        <p> This approach also unlocks some exciting features: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deep linking to a specific test without needing to run a node test server.</li>
            <li>Two-way communication between the browser and test (node) context.</li>
            <li>Access to all the DX features that come with Playwright (excluding the ones that come with @playwright/test).</li>
            <li>Video recording of tests, trace viewing, and pause page functionality for trying out different page selectors/actions.</li>
            <li>Ability to make assertions on spies in the browser in node, matching snapshot of the call within the browser.</li>
        </ul>
